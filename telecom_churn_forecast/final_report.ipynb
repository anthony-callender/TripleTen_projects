    "# Solution Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps Executed:\n",
    "1. **Reading The Data:** Completed as per the plan. Verified uniqueness and absence of missing values.\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Lowercased column names, merged dataframes, and converted columns to appropriate formats.\n",
    "3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Summarized data; identified outliers in contract duration distribution.\n",
    "4. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:** Created target feature, addressed class imbalance, applied encoding, and scaled data.\n",
    "5. **Modeling:** Trained XGBoost classifier, conducted hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Skipped Steps and Reasons:\n",
    "None of the steps from the plan were skipped. Each step was crucial in preparing the data, understanding its characteristics, and building a robust predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encountered Difficulties & Solutions:\n",
    "- **Outlier Identification:** Addressed outliers in contract duration distribution by plotting boxplots and applying standard threshold criteria (1.5).\n",
    "- **Class Imbalance:** Managed class imbalance by up-sampling the minority class to ensure balanced representation.\n",
    "- **Model Selection:** We used XGBoost due to its compatibility with tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps in Task Resolution:\n",
    "- **Data Preparation:** Merging dataframes, formatting columns, and ensuring data integrity.\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering:** Creating target labels, handling class imbalance, encoding categorical variables.\n",
    "- **Model Training:** Utilizing XGBoost and optimizing its performance via hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Model & Quality Score:\n",
    "The final model employed is an XGBoost classifier. Post hyperparameter tuning, the model achieved an AUC-ROC score of 0.84, indicating a strong predictive capability for identifying customer churn.\n",
