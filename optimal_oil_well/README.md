# Project: Find the Best Place for a New Well

## Objective
The main aim of this project is to determine the optimal region for developing new oil wells. This involves maximizing potential profit while considering associated risks. The project follows a series of steps involving data analysis, model training, profit calculations, and risk assessment to identify the region that offers the highest average profit while ensuring that the risk of losses remains below a specified threshold (2.5%).

## Steps to Choose the Location
1. **Data Collection:** Gather oil well parameters in the selected region, including oil quality and volume of reserves.
2. **Build Prediction Models:** Develop models for predicting the volume of reserves in new wells.
3. **Selection Process:** Choose oil wells with the highest estimated values.
4. **Identify Optimal Region:** Determine the region with the highest total profit for the selected oil wells.

## Data Preparation
The project involves three regions, each with data represented in CSV files: `geo_data_0.csv`, `geo_data_1.csv`, and `geo_data_2.csv`. The data preparation phase includes importing necessary libraries, reading data, checking for duplicates, and performing data preprocessing tasks like scaling numeric features.

## Modeling
Utilizes Linear Regression models for each region to predict the volume of reserves in new oil wells. Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R2 score, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are calculated for model evaluation.

## Analysis for Each Region
Analyzes the performance and predictive capabilities of models for each region by assessing MSE, RMSE, average volume of predicted reserves, R2 score, and MAE.

## Profit Calculation
Calculates the volume of reserves needed for development without losses and compares it with the average volume of reserves in each region. It considers budget, revenue from raw materials, and managing risk to determine regions suitable for development.

## Risks and Profit Calculation
Utilizes bootstrapping technique with 1000 samples to find the distribution of profit, calculating average profit, 95% confidence interval, and risk of losses expressed as a percentage. This step analyzes the potential risks and profitability of each region.

## Analysis Summary
Provides a comprehensive summary of the analysis for each region, showcasing average total profit, confidence intervals, and risk of losses for informed decision-making.

## Conclusion
Recommends Region 2 as the most favorable choice for oil well development due to its highest average total profit, narrower confidence interval, and lowest risk of losses compared to other regions. Regions 1 and 3 show potential but come with more uncertainties and relatively higher risks.
