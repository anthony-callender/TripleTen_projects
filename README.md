# TripleTen_projects
Projects I worked on while attending the Data Science TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | Gold Recovery Process Analysis | ML model for Zyfra predicts gold yield from ore, optimizing production in heavy industry. Enhances efficiency & cuts unprofitable parameters. |
| 2 | [Optimal Well Location Identification for OilyGiant Mining](https://github.com/zarina-perez/TripleTen_projects/tree/main/02-EDA_project) | Leveraged predictive models and profit analysis across three regions to pinpoint the most suitable well locations. |
| 3 | [Taxi Order Prediction for Sweet Lift Taxi] | Engineered a predictive model specifically designed for forecasting airport taxi orders during peak hours, meeting stringent RMSE metric requirements. |
| 4 | [Telecom Churn Prediction for Interconnect] | Engineered a machine learning model to forecast client churn, thereby enhancing customer retention strategies. |
